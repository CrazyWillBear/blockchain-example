Blockchain Example

This is a sample project for how a link-list works in C++. I made it into a "Blockchain" for fun so I could store username and value variables. Explanations are available in the form of comments throughout the code.

The license is MIT, simply because this is a template for people trying to learn data structure and basic memory management in C++.

In order to run, clone the repo and build+run using Make: `git clone https://github.com/CrazyWillBear/blockchain-example; cd blockchain-example; make`
